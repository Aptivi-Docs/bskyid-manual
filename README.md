# Welcome!

This project, written in Bash and PowerShell, is a simple tool that gives you your BlueSky ID that is unique to your username. Just get your BlueSky handle from your BlueSky account that you can find over the [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/) website, and pass it to the script. This ID is a unique identifier for your BlueSky account and can't be edited.

This is useful if you want to get your account's BlueSky ID from your handle for developer applications and other apps that use this ID.
